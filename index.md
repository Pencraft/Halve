# About me

I'm a programmer from California. I've worked as a
computer science tutor at the University of Chicago,
as an independent copy editor, and generally enjoy 
designing anything from card games to conscripts.
I love technology, media, and language. Oh, and Japan.

This is my personal site, where I keep all my assorted
projects and occassionally blog about stuff I like. I'll
try to update frequently; no guarantees.

This website uses the [Halve](https://github.com/TaylanTatli/Halve) theme by [Taylan Tatli](https://github.com/TaylanTatli).
